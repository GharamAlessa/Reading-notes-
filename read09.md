### What is functional programming?
> Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.


### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> A pure function is a function which Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
Has no side-effects


### What are the benefits of a pure function?
 + They’re easier to reason about
+ They’re easier to combine
+ They’re easier to test
+ They’re easier to debug
+ They’re easier to parallelize
+ They are idempotent
+ They offer referential transparency
+ They are memoizable
+ They can be lazy
### What is immutability?
> An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created. Conversely, a mutable object is any object which can be modified after it’s created.


### What is Referential transparency?
> Referential transparency, a term commonly used in functional programming, means that given a function and an input value, you will always receive the same output.


### What is a module?
> Modules are typically incorporated into the program (software) through interfaces.

### What does the word ‘require’ do?


> require() is basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object.


### How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
> you need to split the code into multiple files(modularization).
### What do we have to do to make a module available?
> You need to use the import keyword along with the desired module name.
