 ## Component Based Architecture
 #### *What is a component?*
 > component architecture is a type of application architecture composed of independent, modular, and reusable building blocks called components. 
 The value proposition of a component-based architecture is that it boosts application development time and reduces code fragmentation.
#### *What are the charactistics of a component?*
> 
 + A location in the folder in which to store components. 
 + Component name. The name of the component.
+ Component type name. The name of the component type that is associated with a component. 
 + Version number. The version number of the component. ...
+ Platform. 
+ Check-in date. 
+ Check-in user. 

#### *What are the advantages of using component based architecture?*

> Advantages. Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no
impact on the other components or the system as a whole. Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost 

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

#### *What is props short for?* 
> “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. 
#### *How are props used in React?*
> React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object. 

#### *What is the flow of props?*
> There are basically two ways that data gets handled in React: props and state (available through this.state ).
 A third is context, not discussed here, which is more advanced and not currently guaranteed stable (React Docs: Context).
