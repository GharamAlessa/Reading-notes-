> used to obtain an access token to authorize API requests. … Access tokens while having a limited lifetime, can be renewed with a refresh token. A refresh token is valid indefinitely and provides ability for your application to schedule tasks on behalf of a user without their interaction.

#### What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)? 
> The Authorization Code Flow + PKCE is an OpenId Connect flow specifically designed to authenticate native or mobile application users. This flow is considered best practice when using Single Page Apps (SPA) or Mobile Apps. PKCE, pronounced “pixy” is an acronym for Proof Key for Code Exchange.

#### What is Implicit Flow with Form Post? 
> Implicit Flow with Form Post flow uses OIDC to implement web sign-in that is very similar to the way SAML and WS-Federation operates. The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls.

#### What is Client Credentials Flow? 
> The Client Credentials flow is a server to server flow. There is no user authentication involved in the process. … This flow is useful for systems that need to perform API operations when no user is present. It can be nightly operations, or other that involve contacting OAuth protected APIs.
